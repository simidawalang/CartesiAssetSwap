# Cartesi Asset Swap

A marketplace where assets like land, precious metals and stones etc. can be traded. Rather than going through a lengthy documentation process, the proof of ownership (such as an NFT etc.) is simply transferred to the buyer until they are ready to trade again.The assets are first submitted for review by the DAO in order to prevent the trade of illicit or illegal assets, the approved listing are then put up for sale. The assets could either have a fixed price or asking price. The DAO receives a small percentage of each sale as commission.
